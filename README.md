# Rg+Fzf+Vim+Nvim
These are scripts you can source from your ~/.zshrc and/or ~/.bashrc

By using the magic provided by ripgrep and fzf, you can speed up your workflow and quickly navigate to files and jump to lines after performing a live grep. This was inspired by telescope, and it would be neat if you can do live_grep and find_files from the command line. 

# Prerequisites

- Install ripgrep
  
- Install fzf
  
Follow their repos directions appropriatley so that the installation goes smoothly.
