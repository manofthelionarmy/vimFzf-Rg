# Rg+Fzf+Vim+Nvim
These are scripts you can source from your ~/.zshrc and/or ~/.bashrc

By using the magic provided by ripgrep and fzf, you can speed up your workflow and quickly navigate to files and jump to lines in vim or neovim after performing a live grep. This was inspired by telescope.nvim, and it would be neat if you can do live_grep and find_files from the command line. 

# Prerequisites

- Install neovim/vim
  
- Install ripgrep
  
- Install fzf

- Install bat
